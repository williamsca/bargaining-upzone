Good morning Tom,
                                I just discussed the waiver situation with the developer Mr. Carlos Montenegro.  He advised me to put a hold on the waiver application at this time.  He will follow up with us on the waiver after the rezoning application goes through the Planning Commission and BOCS public hearing.  Please let me know if you need any other information.
Thanks
Raj Bidari
