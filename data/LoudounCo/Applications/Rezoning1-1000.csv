As statedin the letter, a pre-application meeting (PRAP 2002-0057) was held    regarding the proposed rezoning of the property to RC Rural           Commercial. At that meeting a question arose as to whether the parcel meets the maximum district requirement of 5 acres as stated in Section2-902 of the Zoning Ordinance. Such text reads ""Except for those      existing commercial uses which are to be converted to the Rural       Commercial District, new rural commercial districts shall contain no  less than .5 acres nor more than 5 acres""                             Approximately 4.6 acres are currently zoned RC on the west side of    Ashburn Road, immediately across the street from the subject property.In addition, approximately 36 acres adjacent to the northeastern      property line of the subject property is zoned RC. If the property    were rezoned to RC, it would become a part of the existing RC         district, creating an RC district of approximately 45 acres, thus     exceeding the 5-acre maximum district size. Therefore, the subject    parcel, in combination with the adjacent RC District would not meet   the requirements of Section 2-902.                                    In response to the particular questions raised in the June 27th       letter, the proposed rezoning would be considered to be expanding the existing district limits and would not be permissible. The proposed   rezoning would not be a new RC District, but rather the expansion of  an existing RC District. The question regarding the necessity of a    Comprehensive Plan Amendment to expand the district is irrelevant as  the zoning ordinance specifically states that the maximum district    size is 5 acres.                                                      1993 ZO: 2-902                                                        LCTM: /79/A/1////16/                                                  PIN: 086-47-0275"

In addition, the property is subject to the  conditions of Zoning Map Amendment                                    [ZMAP 1999-0024], proffers dated November 2, 2000 and a Letter of     Clarification dated February 28, 2001.                                A preliminary plat is currently under review by Loudoun County for    this development [SBPL 2001-0021] .                                   The first inquiry is regarding whether a proposed layout is in        conformance with the approved rezoning                                documents for this property. Proffer I states that the property shall be developed in substantial conformance                               to the Sketch Plan of Maximum Development Potential. The amended      street layout [submitted with SBPL                                    2001 -0021] indicates that the intersection of the inte1ior roadway   (Trask Crescent Circle) has been moved                                fmther to the n01th from the intersection of Wax pool Road and that a portion of an interior ""loop road"" has                                been eliminated, creating a cul-de-sac. This revision results in the  street layout not being in substantial                                conformance with the Sketch Plan of Maximum Development Potential.    However, as Proffer V.A. states ""the public roads built on the        property shall be designed and constructed in                         accordance with the Virginia Department of Transportation (""VDOT"") andCounty standards, or with                                             1nodified standards as may be approved by VDOT and the County .... "", the street layout may be modified to                                  satisfy VDOT. Two adjustments have been made to the street layout.    First, the intersection of Waxpool                                    Road and Trask Crescent Circle has been shifted to the north in       response to VDOT comments and lots have                               been placed between Trask Crescent Circle and Waxpool Road. Secondly, the internal loop road with a stub                                    road has been converted to a cul-de-sac. A letter from Rashid Siraj ofVDOT states that the street layout was                                revised to remove a stub road in response to VDOT concerns regarding  snow removal operations. As both of                                   the revisions were in response to VDOT comments, they are acceptable  adjustments to the approved layout.                                   The second inquiry is whether the submitted documentation regarding anestablished escrow account                                            satisfactmily meets the requirements of Proffer X.C. The documentationprovided evidencing the                                               establishment of an escrow account in accordance with Proffer X.C is  satisfies the proffer requirement.

The property could be subdivided without rezoining if a    new well weere drilld.

An          application to convert this property to the requirements of the 1993  Loudoun County Zoning Ordinance [ZCON 2001-0002] is currently under   review by the County. During the review of the ZCON application, it   was discovered that a portion of the property is subject to proffers  that affect its development potential.                                The adjacent Peace Plantation property to the west was rezoned in     December of 1994 to PD-H6 with the approval of ZMAP 1993-0003. Two    ""slivers"" of property on the eastern boundary of the Peace Plantation property, totaling approximately 0.26 acre, were specifically excludedfrom the rezoning and were later                                      added to the BMW property through a Boundary Line Adjustment [BLAD    1995-0049]. Although these slivers shared the same zoning designation as the BMW property (PD-IP administered under the 1972 zoning         ordinance), they retained the proffers associated with a previous     rezoning of the Peace Plantation property [ZMAP 1985-0011].           The letter asked how the .26 acre ""slivers"" of property will be       treated with the future development of the BMW Property (Tax Map 80   ((11)) Parcel 2). The proffers associated with ZMAP 1985-0011 stated  that the proffers are applicable with the development of the property subject to the rezoning application.                                  Therefore, if the 0.26 acre slivers of property (the only remaining   portion of the subject rezoning) are not developed, then the proffers are not triggered.                                                    1993 ZO: 4-505(B)(2), 4-505(B)(3)                                     ZCOR-2001-0002                                                        ZMAP-1985-0011                                                        LCTM: /80//11/////2/ and /80/////////86;                              PIN: 031-27-8349, 031-28-2675"

The November 10, 1999 Letter of Clarification of Proffer Statement    associated with ZMAP 1998-0006 specifically states that the units willbe developed as ""either a for-sale condominium or a rental townhouse  community ...

Therefore, the units must be constructed as townhouses, not as        multi-family units. Although the units are proposed to be rental, the zoning ordinance does not distinguish between units for sale and      those for rent.

Thorough                                           review of County land records relevant to Broad Run Office Center     confirmed the presence                                                of an error and subsequently established the correct zoning           designation of the site.                                              Specifically, the subject property was found to be split-zoned PD-GI  and PD-IP as                                                          administered under the 1993 Loudoun County Zoning Ordinance.

The establishment of the subject parcel's history was integral to the accurate identification of                                            the correct zoning designation. Specifically, the portion of the      subject parcel currently zoned                                        PD-GI was found to have originally existed as part of LCTM 94((17)),  Parcel B, an 84.915                                                   acre lot which was rezoned from R-1 and A-3, respectively, to PD-GI   via ZMAP #1986-                                                       0019 (approved September 21, 1987).

Hence, as a result of the                                                                consolidation , the subject property was split-zoned PD-GI and PD-IP  with the division                                                     between the zoning designations located along the vacated property    lines of LCTM 94((17)) ,                                              Parcel B.
