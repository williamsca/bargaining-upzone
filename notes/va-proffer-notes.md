Note that after July 1, 2019, developers could choose whether their application was evaluated under the old or the new act. This change was anticipated by January 2019 and likely affected the number of applications submitted in the first half of 2019.

Note: VA counties have special assessments for agriculture, horticultural, forest, and open space lands. If land is converted to a non-qualifying use through a rezoning, the owner is subject to roll-back taxes based on the difference between the land's fair market value and its value under the special assessment for a period of up to six years plus simple interest!

## Chesterfield Response
See '.../references' for the story

> Prior to the 2016 overhaul, the county government assessed the same $18,966 cash proffer to every residential unit built in Chesterfield – whether it was a 4,000-square-foot single-family home or an 850-square-foot apartment.
> “That kept the [apartment] market away,” Haasch says. “That’s a lot of money you’re forking over for an apartment complex versus what you’d get in return.”
> Following passage of proffer reform legislation in the Virginia General Assembly, the Board of Supervisors cut Chesterfield’s cash proffer in half – to $9,400 per unit.
> That prompted many developers of residential projects zoned under the old proffer system to apply for rezoning.

## Arlington
Arlington County has commercial linkage fees, not proffers, and reports $0 in proffer revenues.
