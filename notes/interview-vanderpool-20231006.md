# Game Plan
Call Mike Vanderpool (703-369-4738), real estate attorney working in Prince William and Manassas, to ask about:

Data on proffers

> No

Which counties are most affected by PRA16? Confirm Arlington was unaffected

> 

Data indicate a shift to multifamily construction. Clear for some counties (e.g., Chesterfield), but is this widespread?

> Yes, Mike saw this. Recently it has turned back to single-family due to "interest rates and inflation" according to conversations with developers.

Did reform have long-run effect on proffer rates? Did counties start asking for larger proffers after 2019 update?

> Yes. Proffers persistently lower now than they were before 2016. Described a recent push by jurisdictions for developers to submit a proffer under "D1" (a clause in which the developer states that the proffer is reasonable) which Mike anticipates will result in another clash in the state courts.

Did reform have long-run effect on residential land supply? Are counties more or less willing to approve rezonings?

Was *Koontz* decision relevant to VA?

> No

Other noteworthy proffer reforms

> Supreme Court just accepted a case out of California that hinges on whether impact fees imposed by the state legislature are subject to Nolan/Dolan. Mike believes the court will find that they are.

Development characteristics that affect proffers, approvals (size, housing type, etc.)

> Proffer amounts vary wildly depend on school district capacity. Can be massively different for adjacent parcels across a district boundary if the development would force the district to build a new school. A new high school in NOVA costs $157 million.
