# Game Plan
- Call Mike Vanderpool (703-369-4738), real estate attorney working in Prince William and Manassas, to ask about:
  - Data on proffers
  - Which counties are most affected by PRA16?
  - Was *Koontz* decision relevant to VA?
  - Other noteworthy proffer reforms
  - Development characteristics that affect proffers, approvals
  - Data indicate a shift to multifamily construction. Clear some counties (e.g., Chesterfield), but is this widespread?
  - Did reform have long-run effect on proffer rates? Did counties start asking for large proffers after 2019 update?
