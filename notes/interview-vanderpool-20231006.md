# Game Plan
Call Mike Vanderpool (703-369-4738), real estate attorney working in Prince William and Manassas, to ask about:
- Data on proffers
- Which counties are most affected by PRA16? Confirm Arlington was unaffected
- Was *Koontz* decision relevant to VA?
- Other noteworthy proffer reforms
- Development characteristics that affect proffers, approvals (size, housing type, etc.)
- Data indicate a shift to multifamily construction. Clear for some counties (e.g., Chesterfield), but is this widespread?
- Did reform have long-run effect on proffer rates? Did counties start asking for larger proffers after 2019 update?
- Did reform have long-run effect on residential land supply? Are counties more or less willing to approve rezonings?
