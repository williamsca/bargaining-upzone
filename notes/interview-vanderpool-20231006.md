# Game Plan
Call Mike Vanderpool (703-369-4738), real estate attorney working in Prince William and Manassas, to ask about:

Data on proffers

> No

Which counties are most affected by PRA16? Confirm Arlington was unaffected

> To an extent, but even Arlington is subject to VA and US constitutions. There is a separate state statue which allows Arlington, Fairfax, and Loudoun to have mandatory affordable units; Mike believes this is unconstitutional.

Data indicate a shift to multifamily construction. Clear for some counties (e.g., Chesterfield), but is this widespread?

> Yes, Mike saw this. Recently it has turned back to single-family due to "interest rates and inflation" according to conversations with developers.

Did reform have long-run effect on proffer rates? Did counties start asking for larger proffers after 2019 update?

> Proffers persistently lower now than they were before 2016. Described a recent push by jurisdictions for developers to submit a proffer under "D1" (a clause in which the developer states that the proffer is reasonable) which Mike anticipates will result in another clash in the state courts.

> Pre-2016, counties published proffer schedules. There are minutes from school boards where they discuss the fact that neighboring counties were getting $X/unit and contemplate raising their own suggested proffers.

Did reform have long-run effect on residential land supply? Are counties more or less willing to approve rezonings?

Was *Koontz* decision relevant to VA?

> No. Mike suggests reading *Koontz* decision. The Supreme Court felt that impact fees have a "coercive effect" because the jurisdiction has all of the bargaining power: many developers and a single jurisdiction, and developers may have millions at stake.

Other noteworthy proffer reforms

> Supreme Court just accepted a case out of California that hinges on whether impact fees imposed by the state legislature are subject to Nolan/Dolan. Mike believes the court will find that they are. Recent Albemarle case (2023) clarified status of D1 proffers.

Development characteristics that affect proffers, approvals (size, housing type, etc.)

> Proffer amounts vary wildly depend on school district capacity. Can be massively different for adjacent parcels across a district boundary if the development would force the district to build a new school. A new high school in NOVA costs $157 million. Student generation factors typically vary by unit type. Otherwise, proffer amounts depend primarily on the change in the number of by-right units (not the final number) and the number of affordable units (typically, there is no proffer associated with affordable units).

> School construction tends to lag well behind development. Jurisdictions have different approaches to bridge the gap: boundary line adjustments, mobile units, and program adjustments. (This allows them to maximize their proffer revenue.)

> In older neighborhoods, student populations tend to drop. Schools may be reluctant to address a temporary overcrowding problem with a permanent solution. In a recent case, we represented a developer who was asked to contribute a proffer which reflected the cost of building a new school, even though the county had no intention of actually building a new school.

How does a typical proffer negotiation proceed?

> First, we evaluate the development to determine whether it meets the VA statute for a proffer. If it does not, the applicant must decide whether they want to submit a [D1](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title15.2/chapter22/section15.2-2303.4/) proffer under constitutional limitations.

> The uncertainty makes it really hard for developers to pencil out units. Developers pay the landowner $0 for land that must be used to build affordable units. Developers negotiate purchase contracts with landowners with two features: they pay $0 for land used to build affordable units; and the sales price depends on the negotiated proffer. If proffers come in higher than expected, the landowner gets a lower price.

> Developers liked having a number.

Did you notice a decline in housing prices since 2016?

> Not obvious that NOVA prices fell, but they may have elsewhere.
