# Questions for Joe Lerch of VaCo

* How much do local governments care about being eligible to accept cash proffers? 
   * It looks like most cash proffer revenue is collected in and around Arlington County rather than the places that are gaining or losing eligibility based on their growth rates. For instance, Lexington loses eligibility in 2020, but they weren't collecting any revenue from cash proffers before then anyway. 
   * Have counties or cities complained about this restriction?










* Examples of cases when eligibility status was a binding constraint for a local government engaged in negotiations with a developer? In other words, an example where the developer would have made a cash proffer if the locality were eligible to accept it?










* In general, how much of a premium do you think local governments put on cash proffers over in-kind proffers? 














* Examples of how changes in cash proffer eligibility or the 2016 reform affected a particular negotiation?










* Examples of developers leveraging competition between counties to get a better deal?








* How to go find data on individual negotiations and cash proffer amounts?










* Rough breakdown in cash proffers by single-family residential, multi-family residential, and commercial development?
