# Proffer Reform
Presenting at the labor/public workshop clarified what I would need to show in order to proceed with this project.

### How and why did the reform affect proffer negotiations?
Interviewed Mike Vanderpool, a real estate attorney in Prince William and Manassas, to get more context.

### What is the right model?
In the presentation, I described the reform as "an unspecified price ceiling on proffers." Lee pointed out that the impact of a price ceiling on quantity is ambiguous. Under imperfect competition, it could **increase** the supply of residential land (c.f. minimum wage / monopsony).

Despite the striking evidence of rezonings getting shifted to just before and after, total rezonings in treated counties tend to increase after 2016.

I use a synthetic difference-in-differences method to estimate the effect of the reform on housing prices. The results are striking: housing prices fall by 5% in the year after the reform and remain at that level in the long run. This is roughly consistent with a 1:1 pass-through of proffers to housing prices: the Zillow HVI in treated counties is ~$300k, so a 5% decline translates to $15k. This is comparable to typical proffer rates in 2013 (e.g., Albemarle County suggested $20,460).

### Other Updates
- Bike lane project is dead. Thinking about other potential collaborations on questions related to transportation infrastructure.
- Submitting a grant requests to GSASC for $300 to get foot traffic data for a new idea related to how (1) heterogeneity in preferences and (2) work-from-home affect congestion of consumption amenities. The idea is that if everyone prefers to dine on Friday, shop on Saturday, and exercise on Sunday, then those amenities will be crowded and their prices will be higher because the fixed land rent must be borne by fewer consumers. Plan is to check for reduced-form correlations between foot traffic dispersion and local characteristics (e.g., rents, diversity, WFH), and then, if something pops up, to write down a model.
