# bargaining-upzone
How does bargaining between local governments and residential developers affect the housing market?

## Notes from Joe Lerch (VACo Director of Local Govt. Policy) on 4/5/2023
2016/2019 Reforms:
- 2016 "created some problems for approving new development"
- 2019 changes specifically affected NOVA
- Developers agreed that the post-2016 situation was unproductive

In general, eligibility status due to decennial Census growth rates is not an issue.

Most cash proffer revenue is from single-family development "is my guess"

Some possibility of surveying the Coalition of High Growth Communities.

APFO is VACo's preferred policy.

## Notes from Federico 3/13/2023
Consider using a 2nd price auction:
- Need to know who the possible builders are
- Need to consider strategic interactions
