# bargaining-upzone
How does bargaining between local governments and residential developers affect the housing market?

# TODO
Diff-in-diff:
- aggregate to quarterly
- use a synthetic control based on all other US counties (not just VA)

Data:
- Download parcel boundaries + local schema tables and read into R (https://vgin.vdem.virginia.gov/pages/cl-data-download)
- If necessary, look county-by-county for zoning data (e.g., https://www.albemarle.org/government/information-technology/geographic-information-system-gis-mapping/gis-data)

## Notes from Joe Lerch (VACo Director of Local Govt. Policy) on 4/5/2023
2016/2019 Reforms:
- 2016 "created some problems for approving new development"
- 2019 changes specifically affected NOVA
- Developers agreed that the post-2016 situation was unproductive

In general, eligibility status due to decennial Census growth rates is not an issue.

Most cash proffer revenue is from single-family development "is my guess"

Some possibility of surveying the Coalition of High Growth Communities.

APFO is VACo's preferred policy.

## Notes from Federico 3/13/2023
Consider using a 2nd price auction:
- Need to know who the possible builders are
- Need to consider strategic interactions
