## Notes from John McGlennon on 6/5/2023

### Questions:
Are high-growth counties satisfied with the current legal regime around cash proffers?
- The high-growth counties are generally happy to think about other ways to address the impact of growth. Constrained by a system that's been in place for decades.

In general, how much of a premium do you think local governments put on cash over in-kind proffers?
- Hard to judge because counties are so different.
- Potential for shifting from cash proffers to impact fees or offering developers a choice. Some localities are very happy with the existing system. Others, which have already rezoned lots of property but expect lots of development, would be happy to collect impact fees.
- e.g., proposed development scale is very different. "one size doesn't fit all". 

There's been a huge increase in the amount of cash proffer revenue collected by VA localities in the last two decades. What's behind this trend, and is it likely to continue?
- There is interest in impact fee legislation. One of the problems we had the last time that was proposed was that the Homebuilder's wanted the fees to be capped at such a low level that they wouldn't help localities pay for the infrastructure. There is interest in impact fees in addition to, or in lieu of, cash proffers.
- Yes, and probably because localities have been more systematic in looking at the costs incurred of new development. Localities experiencing pushback by existing residents who do not want their taxes to go up.
- Folks who are thinking about how to address these issues: in James City County, we have tried to address the impact of new residential development on affordable housing. We have one proffer on a fairly large development that includes \$1,000 per unit that goes towards affordable housing. Two million dollars into a housing trust fund to provide local housing voucher program. 

I understand that the bulk of reported cash proffer revenue comes from single-family residential uses. Is that correct? Do you have a ballpark guess on what fraction of proffer revenue comes from single-family residential, multi-family residential, and commercial development?
- The bulk probably comes from residential. Commercial is less expensive to provide public servies to. Typically, VDOT regulations require commercial developers to provide those.

Do you have suggestions for how to collect data on individual rezoning negotiations? The DCHD survey has yearly totals, but it would be great to see more detail: the characteristics of the development, the non-cash proffers, the original land use, etc.
- The challenge here is that this is not centrally collected. Will have to come from the localities. In July (13)?, Coalition of High-Growth Communities is sponsoring a workshop looking at infrastructure and housing committee regulation of zoning. Meeting is in Culpeper. Session from 9am-2:30pm.

I've looked at whether the 2016 Proffer Reform Act had any effect on the number of approved single-family building permits for localities that routinely collected cash proffers. The diff-in-diff estimates are imprecise, but they indicate a ~10% decrease. Does that strike you as plausible? Do you think there is any substitution between single- and multi-family housing?
- Primarily driven by homebuilders, who decided that they didn't want to have to deal with proffers any more. They "over-reached significantly" in terms of making it impossible for county elected officials to discuss any impacts a new development would have with developers. Created an imbalance where if localities suggest an impact, it would trigger "almost automatic approval".
- Local government officials were advised "don't talk to developers"
- What ultimately happened was that the legislation was changed so a developer could opt for the old system. My understanding is that developers recognize the their proposals will generate significant local costs and they made a mistake with the reform act.
- Fix occurred in 2018 or 2019.

I appreciate any insight into the political economy of the 2016 reform, the 2019 fix, and what might be next.

More broadly, I'm curious how Virginia conditional zoning policy differs from other states.
- Virginia does not allow impact fees, which are commonly used elsewhere. Proffers are only available when there is a rezoning, while impact fees can be applied to any new development. 

[Cash proffer revenue as a share of all revenue]


## Notes from Joe Lerch (VACo Director of Local Govt. Policy) on 4/5/2023
2016/2019 Reforms:
- 2016 "created some problems for approving new development"
- 2019 changes specifically affected NOVA
- Developers agreed that the post-2016 situation was unproductive

In general, eligibility status due to decennial Census growth rates is not an issue.

Most cash proffer revenue is from single-family development "is my guess"

Some possibility of surveying the Coalition of High Growth Communities.

APFO is VACo's preferred policy.

## Notes from Federico 3/13/2023
Consider using a 2nd price auction:
- Need to know who the possible builders are
- Need to consider strategic interactions
